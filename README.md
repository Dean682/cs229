# Stanford CS229: Machine Learning, Fall 2017
Solutions for Stanford CS229: Machine Learning, Fall 2017

Here are my own solutions to all homeworks, for Prof. Andrew Ng's Masters-Level Machine Learning [course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)

Each problem set's solutions are presented as one or more jupyter notebooks. The top-level jupyter notebooks for each problem set  are listed below. They link to other notebooks, for more-involved problems (e.g. Reinforcement Learning in PS#4). Each top-level jupyter notebook includes screenshots of each problem's text and graphics, as a convenience to the reader.

Please note: 
- All errors are my own.
- Because I completed the course materials independently (without access to Teaching Assistants or Recitations), I did consult other cs229 solutions, to better understand questions, esp. for Locally-Weighted Linear Regression, as well as Reinforcement Learning. Credits:
